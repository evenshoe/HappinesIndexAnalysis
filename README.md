# HappinessIndexAnalysis

This program performs an analysis on the happiness index dataset. 

It includes a correlation analysis to determine which variables show the highest correlation with the happiness index, tests different regression models to predict the happiness score, and performs a sensitivity analysis to determine which factors have the greatest impact on the happiness score.

The results are visualized with plots, including a heatmap of the correlation matrix, a scatter plot for the regression model, and a bar plot for variable importance.
